# Reporting for WinForms - Master-Detail Report Created in Code (obsolete)

This example shows how to create a master-detail reportÂ in code. 

> **Note**
> This example uses the ADO.NET library with a Microsoft Access database and [legacy Data Bindings](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/401991/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/use-report-controls/bind-report-controls-to-data/migrate-from-legacy-data-bindings-to-expressions).

The following steps are essential to create a report layout:
1. Create a report instance and bind it to data.
2. Add report bandsÂ to the report.
3. Add report controlsÂ to the created bands and create data bindings.

After the report layout is complete, generate the report document and display it in the **Print Preview** dialog window.
